FCFS:
The more heavy processes at the beginning, the worse the performance of the rest
SJF:
The more heavy-weight processes, the worse the performance
RR:
The performance largely depends on quantum. If quantum too big, then there are problems like in FCFS. If quantum is too small, then there are problem like in SJF.
